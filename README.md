## why?
I'm an undergraduate student and i like reading online pdfs from programming to comics. I usually spend my most of the time with my computer.
While seating in front of computer it becomes handy to me to read online books and take notes side by side, rather than physical books.

So, i thought of collecting them in one piece and it becomes a pretty nice replacement for my browser bookmarks. It is an invaluable source of knowledge for me that I often look back on.

## Pull requests?
If you have some book/pdf that contain some knowledge and helpful you can create a `pr`. I'll see!

## Ownership
The pdf's under this repository, I've downloaded from different sites, I have no way of knowing if there is a copyright on these books. If you find a pdf hosted
in this repository that is yours and of limited use, please let me know and i will remove it.
